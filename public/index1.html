        In today`s world, technology is changing lives across the world.
        As a result, millions of people are living in the information age
        and they derive great benefits from the use of their native languages.
        Unfortunately, people of Eritrea and entire Ethiopia face a myriad of challenges
        mostly derived from their writing system which consists of a large number of
        characters that are not fully supported on all operating systems. Currently,
        all operating systems come without standard Input Method Editor for Tigrigna
        writing and no input method solution and standard keyboard layout for Tigrigna writing system has existed so
        far.
        Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to design Phonetic-based
        keyboard mapping algorithm and keyboard layout for Tigrigna. Designing
        such an algorithm and a corresponding keyboard layout, however,
        requires scholarly investigation of challenges that are associated
        with Tigrigna scripts and immediate solution for a number of technical
        challenges like mapping about 300 characters onto the limited number
        of keys on standard keyboard, character entry speed and easiness to use among others.
        This study proposed an algorithm that used Phonetic-based keyboard mapping technique,
        highest frequency among Tigrigna order forms, and syllable matrix of Tigrigna scripts arrangement.
        The designed algorithm and keyboard layout was implemented and tested by developing JavaScript
        Tigrigna Input Method Editor. Finally a comparison test among the developed Editor,
        Google IME and Microsoft IME was done to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the
        newly designed algorithm when compared with these pre-existing IMEs. The test results showed that;
        the new Editor gives the fastest typing speed with minimum key combinations and errors free. Therefore,
        for Tigrigna language, Phonetic based keyboard mapping is more efficient compared other keyboard mapping
        techniques.
